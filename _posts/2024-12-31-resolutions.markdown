Another year has passed and a lot has changed. Last year, I didn't write New Year’s resolutions because I got a job in Barcelona and moved back! Even though I didn't write the resolutions I wanted to share my “accomplishments" outlining my goals for 2025.

This year, I started a new job at AstraZeneca where I've worked as an analyst in the HEOR department. Great job with great colleagues. If you plan to apply let me know :D This also implied that I left Sydney to return to Barcelona. During the few months in Barcelona, I got to attend ISPOR and assisted in the business week organized by the MBA I'm coursing. I organized an axe-throwing event with my work colleagues that everyone loved.

On my personal side, I took up quite a few cool hobbies. I wanted to start dancing again so I went to some salsa socials and started learning bachata. But the hobbies that surprised everyone were doing standup and performing in mid-December. All of that helped me to make new friends in the city. I also had time to do a couple of cool vacation travels. During summer I went to the Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) plus Finland. then in November, I visited northern India and Bhutan.

Overall, I'm surprised how it went and happy I had time to do so much. And now the cool stuff. 

## New year's resolutions for 2025

1. Finish the MBA including the final project (TBD)
2. Take a poetry course with a potential performance at the end (3 months, January to March)
3. Continue with my standup. Aiming for 3 performances.
4. Reduce doom scrolling, YouTube, and Netflix. Instead, be more productive or read books. Proactively use Trello to track my projects and ongoing tasks.
5. Meditate daily for at least 10 minutes. I need to figure out the best time for it.
6. Keep working out in the morning. No particular sports accomplishments in mind.
7. Read all the physical books I've been compiling for the last year.
8. Get a (no ink) tattoo.
9. Do paragliding at least once (in spring?)
10. Do bungee jumping once (during summer?)
11. Visit Iceland (maybe see the Nordic lights)
12. Explore an interesting country, maybe Cuba? Or Korea? Something in Africa?


This upcoming year motivates me and fills me with energy. Think big because the sky is the limit. And like every year my mantra is: when in doubt choose the adventure, conquer the world, survive another year, and (most importantly) be happy.

Happy New Year! :D
