I was recently struggling to insert code snippets into this blog. I tried SyntaxHighlighter Evolved among others. And I didn't like the outcome... (CSS is messed up?). The way to go?

1\. Create a Gist thanks to Github ( https://gist.github.com/ ) 2. Copy the embedded JS script they offer you after publishing the code snippet. 3. Put it on your website

Nice, isn't it?
