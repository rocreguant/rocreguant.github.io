Everyone is so obsessed with tools that we forget to reflect. Cutting edge tools won't make you better at your craft. If you're already good at it will improve but tools by themselves won't make you a professional. A professional photographer carries around many different lenses and gadgets to carry on with their work. However, if you don't know about photography buying the same set of items as the professionals won't make you a professional by chance.

You need to develop the skill and keep upgrading your tools so they match your skill level. You can't screw a nail into the wall. Skill will tell you to hammer it. It is easy to start a new hobby or work project and desire to use the cutting-edge high-performance tool but maybe it would be better to start small and keep upgrading your tools along with your skills.
