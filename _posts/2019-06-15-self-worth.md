As long as you try to impress others, you are not convinced of your own strength. As long as you strive to be better than others, you are doubting your own worth. As long as you try to elevate yourself by lowering others, you are doubting your own greatness. Who is in peace with oneself doesn’t have to prove anything to others. Who knows one’s own worth doesn’t need validation. Who knows about one’s own greatness lets others keep theirs. _\-Gabriele Ebbighausen_
