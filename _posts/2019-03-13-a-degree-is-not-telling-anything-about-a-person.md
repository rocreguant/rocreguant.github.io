A degree is used for HR departments to asses if a person is qualified for a position or not. A degree is a showcase for a reputation that no one knows about. A degree tells that you were able to survive X amount of years in the university.

A degree does not say if you actually learned anything. A degree does not say if you're an assh\*le or a nice person. A degree does not say if you will aim for perfection at work.

Maybe we go to school because we've been doing that for many years and the easy choice is keep doing the same. Maybe the whole point of pursuing a degree is being with like minded people.

Yet we like spending tremendous amounts of time at the university.
