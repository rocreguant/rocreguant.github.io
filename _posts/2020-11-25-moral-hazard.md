...that occurs when people don't have skin in the game.

If you're able to place a bet and you get the wins but you won't bear the losses why don't you go all in every time? We should look for people that have skin in the game, they can still err but at least they will suffer the consequences. It's very easy to bet on other people's money and walk away when things don't look good.

It's not only us that should check we have skin in the game but check the others as well to identify and ignore charlatans. Words are easy and titles do not provide skin in the game. Do the hard work results will come.
