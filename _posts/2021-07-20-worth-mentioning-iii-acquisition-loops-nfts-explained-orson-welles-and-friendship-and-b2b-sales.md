This is the continuation of the _[worth mentioning experiment](https://rocreguant.com/worth-mentioning-ii-phd-survival-guide-ergodicity-death-after-75-content-marketing-and-email-marketing/1636/)_ where I shared relevant links to be kept for future references.

**[Acquisition Loops](https://nogood.io/2019/10/01/growth-acquisition-loops-funnel)**: The old ways of acquiring new customers -aka funnels- are outdated. Modern brands are adapting their marketing strategy and shifting their tactics to acquisition loops. In this article, there is an explanation accompanied by some examples from relevant brands.

**[NFTs, explained](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq)**: Currently cryptocurrencies are in everybody's mouth. Even newer trends are the Non-Fungible Tokens (NTF) which are a piece of information that certified your ownership over a digital asset. This link explains it in detail on a conversation style addressing most of the typical questions an average person may have.

**[Orson Welles, art and friends](hip:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7VnOJT7bi4)**: He is an innovative professional that has interesting takes on art and friendship. This is a 2min video worth paying attention to. He regards his friendships over any of his art in spite of maybe regretting those choices. So, in the end, we're all people.

**[Winning Through Intimidation](http://bookoutlines.pbworks.com/w/page/14422735/Winning%20Through%20Intimidation)**: This is a book summary very concise and clarifying. The concepts are simple but worth knowing to be aware of when you're being played.

**[30 B2B sales techniques that work](https://www.agilecrm.com/blog/30-b2b-sales-techniques/)**: Most of the sales techniques on internet are B2C. However, in this instance, I found a worthy not-so-basic guide for B2B. It is worth keeping around.
