Most of the time we roam around earth without a clear direction. We let the winds guide us, we accept everything, we take up activities because some friend asked. Just because we don't dislike something it does not mean that we like it. Yeah, I could read this book, but it's an ok book. Wouldn't it be better to read that other awesome book? Just because it is there does not mean that you should take it in. We should stop doing things that do not spark joy in us and create space for the activities that brightens us up.

So every time you need to take a decision think. Is it a _hell yes!!_ ? if not, then it's a sharp no. No shame, no regrets. Otherwise you will be to busy for the things that make you happy.
