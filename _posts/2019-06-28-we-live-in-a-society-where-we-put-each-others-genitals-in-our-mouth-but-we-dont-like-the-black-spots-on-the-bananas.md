We are full of contradictions. You think you're smart because you are able to point out the contradictions of the others but you don't escape them either. Some examples:

- Work so we have money for our retirement vs. Be with our families and enjoy them now. We need to do both.
- Democracy vs. People making bad choices. Democracy is not perfect and not good for every society. The problem is what system works better?
- Enjoy every day vs. Live careful, healthy lives.
- Speak your mind vs. Let others be. Let's have free speech, but not be insulting.

In the end all of us have contradictions, but those contradictions have a reason. As Aristotleâ€™s put it _Virtue is the happy medium between two extremes_. Rarely life is white or black. In many cases we need to compromise, don't be afraid to find a middle ground for your ideas.
