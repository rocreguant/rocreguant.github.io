Time at Risk == Value at Risk (if we replace value by time)

E.g. An insurance company's 90% TaR is 3 year for liquidity risk - That means that for 3 years the insurer under the current financial structure would be 90% safe

Time at Risk (TaR for short): is the maximum period of time that an adverse event would not occur. We calculate it as follows:

\[caption id="attachment\_1773" align="aligncenter" width="300"\]![Incidence rate formula](images/incidence_rate_time_at_risk.png) Incidence rate = \\frac{Number of disease cases in a given time period}{Total person time at risk during study period}\[/caption\]

The units are cases/person-year
