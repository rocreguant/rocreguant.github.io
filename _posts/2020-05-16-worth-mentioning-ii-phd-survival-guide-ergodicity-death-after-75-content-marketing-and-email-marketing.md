This is the continuation of the _[worth mentioning experiment](https://rocreguant.com/worth-mentioning-i-content-generation-flywheels-network-effects-what-customers-want-instagram-bots/1594/)_ where I shared links that I deemed important to be kept for future references.

**[A graduate school survival guide: "So long, and thanks for the Ph.D!](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/hitch4.html):** On this essay Ronald Azuma states the path to a successful PhD defense. He states a few things that may seem obvious be we often forget. He is not arguing in favor of a PhD title, he simply states that what works for some may not work for others.

**[The Logic of Risk Taking](https://medium.com/incerto/the-logic-of-risk-taking-107bf41029d3):** I wanted to include this link to remember the term **ergodicity** explained by Nassim Taleb. An ergodic system has the same behavior averaged over time as averaged over the space. A non-ergodic system is when observed past probabilities do not apply to future processes (Russian roulette).

**[A doctor and medical ethicist argues life after 75 is not worth living](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614156/a-doctor-and-medical-ethicist-argues-life-after-75-is-not-worth-living/):** This is an interview of Ezekiel Emanuel where he argues that trying to keep people alive past 75 is a waste of resources that bring little to the society. Instead, all of those resources should be invested in the younger generations to live a better life. Controversial argument but worth reading it.

**[Guide for content marketing in 2020.](https://backlinko.com/content-marketing-this-year)**Very well researched and interesting guide for content marketing in 2020. It contains information from email marketing and video marketing to engagement and trends. It doesn't disappoint at all.

**[Marketing lifecycle applied to newsletters.](https://www.getvero.com/resources/lifecycle-marketing/)** In this excellent post, the author maps the different phases of marketing to email marketing. It starts with awareness, then engagement, purchase, retention, growth, and advocacy.
